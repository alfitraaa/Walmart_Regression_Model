# Regression Analysis on Walmart Sales: Analyzing the Impact of CPI and Holiday
## Project: Statistics for Business
---
## Introduction

Sales are vital for any business, and predicting them accurately is crucial. For a retail giant like Walmart in the US, understanding sales performance is not just important; it's necessary. Imagine having the ability to forecast daily product sales, taking into account economic conditions, holidays, and other influencing factors. This capability could be a game-changer, enabling companies to make smarter decisions and allocate resources more effectively.

In the ever-changing retail landscape, making well-informed decisions is the key to success. We were given an important task: to create a regression model that explores how specific variables - Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Holiday_Flag - affect Walmart's weekly sales, with the hope of achieving more precise sales predictions. This idea comes from noticing that sales go up a lot during holidays.
## Objective

Through this project, we aim to address important questions: Do these factors have a significant effect on sales? Can a model built around CPI and Holiday_Flag truly yield accurate sales predictions? With data from 45 Walmart stores, our main goal is to use statistical tests and develop a model to identify the effect of these variables. Our objectives are:

1. Identify the relationships among variables.
2. Conduct hypothesis testing to assess the impact of holidays on sales.
3. Develop regression models to predict sales.

With these objectives, we will be able to analyze and determine whether the model built with these variables can accurately predict the sales or not.

## Dataset
Walmart Dataset is a historical sales data that covers sales from February 5th 2010 to November 26th 2012, with following details:

- Store: Store number or identifier.
- Date: The date of recorded sales data.
- Weekly_Sales: Sales figures for the specified store during a given week.
- Holiday_Flag: A binary indicator, where 1 signifies a holiday week, and 0 represents a non-holiday week.
- Temperature: The recorded temperature on the day of the sale.
- Fuel_Price: The cost of fuel in the respective region during the week.
- CPI: The current Consumer Price Index, providing insights into the cost of living.
- Unemployment: The current unemployment rate in the region.

## Closing

Due my limited knowledge regarding regression models, I hope to dedicate more time to learning and refining my skills. This way, I aim to build a more accurate predictive model in the future.

Thank you very much for your attention, and I greatly appreciate any advice or input from all of you.
